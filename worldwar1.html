<h1>World War I</h1>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">5 Paragraph Essay</h2>
<p>World War 1 was the first global war that started in Europe. No one was ready for such a big and powerful war, including many countries. It lasted from July 1914 to November 1918. But what’s so important about it? Why does everyone talk about it so much? Well, there are many reasons for it to be so important in history and all the people know about it, just like World War 2.  Let’s see facts that made this war so important.</p>
<p>First of all, the war-affected everyone in the world, because as the name says, it’s worldwide, well, almost worldwide, mostly it was Europe (most affected were Germany and France), but also other countries. Also, we need to know what it affected in the countries I listed above, because every war is bad, but how much actually? This war was pretty bad, it caused around 40 million deaths in total, most deaths coming from Russia (1.7 Million).  During the conflict, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire fought against Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Romania, Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>But what exactly caused the war? No one wants a war on his territory! Well, while no one wants war, everyone wants more control over land. As we studied previously, most of the wars happened because some governments want more control over other countries, want more land, and more people in general working for them. Because before many governments stole money.  On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and the tenuous peace between Europe’s great powers quickly collapsed. Within a week, Russia, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Serbia had lined up against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and World War I had begun. Russian forces invaded the German-held regions of East Prussia and Poland, but were stopped short by German and Austrian forces at the Battle of Tannenberg in late August 1914.</p>
<p>Not only people were affected in this way, but also in an economic way; what does that mean? Production collapsed, leading to a shortage of goods, mostly food. One of the impacts of World War One was huge advances in technology that would transform the way that people all around the world traveled and communicated years after the conflict. Some consequences are still present in our world nowadays. The main problems were: trade, free-flow of people, small government, taxes, and regulation. Some of them would lead to major problems, for example, migrations of people back then were far larger, relatively than those of today. In Britain, early failures in munitions manufacturing led to full government intervention in war production.</p>
<p>So the main question remains, is it really that bad? Generally yes, while it showed us what to do in such situations, it killed many people, brought down the economy, and destroyed many countries. I would say any war is good, every war that happens is a bad conflict between countries that should be avoided when possible, because when it happens, a war! Wars will never stop, at least for the close future, people will always want to get more powerful, and earn more money.</p>
